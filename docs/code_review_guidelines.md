# High-Level Code Review Guidelines

## Review With Purpose
Before diving into the code, understand:
- What feature or bug fix is being implemented?
- Is this code aligned with the overall product and user goals?

## Focus Areas
- **Functionality**: Does the code do what it claims?
- **Clarity**: Is the logic readable and easy to follow?
- **Security**: Any data leaks, injection risks, or sensitive info?
- **Performance**: Are there any obvious bottlenecks?
- **Integration**: Does this work nicely with the frontend/backend?

## Be Constructive
- Use kind, specific language.
- Ask questions instead of issuing demands.
- Praise good practices (modularization, comments, clean logic).

## Encourage Improvement
- Suggest reusable patterns where relevant.
- Offer guidance on best practices (e.g., DRF views, React component reuse).
